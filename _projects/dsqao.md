<!-- [More information here]() -->

* Propose an architecture optimization framework to boost quantum circuit performance by optimizing connectivity.
* Demonstrate up to 59% fidelity improvement in simulation by optimizing the heavy-hexagon architecture for QAOA maxcut circuits, and up to 14% improvement on the grid architecture. For the QCNN circuit, architecture optimization improves fidelity by 11% on the heavy-hexagon architecture and 605% on the grid architecture.
