This is Hsin-Yu's home on the web.

I am a college student currently pursuing a degree in Business Administration with a minor in Accounting at National Taipei University (NTPU).

In my second year, I served as Vice President of Finance and Legality at AIESEC in NTPU, where I developed leadership, problem-solving, and data analysis skills, alongside hands-on experience in accounting and risk management. This role ignited my passion for financial management and risk assessment, motivating me to further explore and deepen my expertise as I build a solid foundation in the financial industry.
